              Hi, I'm AFAQ, a website developer with over 2 years of experience
              in designing and developing custom websites for businesses of all
              sizes. My skills and expertise include proficiency in HTML, CSS,
              JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p class="about__para">
              I'm passionate about creating engaging and user-friendly websites
              that help my clients achieve their business goals. Some of my
              notable projects include developing an e-commerce website for a
              local retailer that resulted in a 50% increase in online sales,
              and creating a responsive website for a startup that increased
              their website traffic by 75%.
            </p>

            <p class="about__para">
              What sets me apart from other website developers is my attention
              to detail, creative problem-solving skills, and ability to deliver
              high-quality work within tight deadlines. I believe that
              communication is key to a successful project, and I always make
              sure to keep my clients informed and involved throughout the
              entire development process.
            </p>
            <p class="about__para">
              If you're looking for a website developer who can help you achieve
              your online goals, I'd love to connect and discuss how I can help.

              examples of my work.
